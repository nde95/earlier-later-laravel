# New Laravel API for Earlier or Later

## About

This is an API created to replace the old Node/Express API to provide the back end functionality to the game [Earlier Or Later](https://github.com/nde95/earlier-or-later). This current API provides much more relaibility and a nice boost in performance to make the game feel smoother.

## Features

-   Leaderboards (now with caching)
-   MySQL instead of MongoDB
-   Registration and Authentication
-   Most importantly, Image storing and fetching for the game itself.
-   Still built entirely on the [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/) API, so big thank you to them for the functionality.
